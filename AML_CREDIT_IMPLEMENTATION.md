# AML & Credit Scoring Implementation Complete! üéâ

## Overview

I have successfully implemented **AML (Anti-Money Laundering) Service** and **Credit Scoring Service** with comprehensive pattern detection, risk assessment, and compliance capabilities. This completes the core AI banking services with advanced risk management and regulatory compliance.

## ‚úÖ **Core Implementation:**

### 1. **AML Detection Service** (`src/services/aml.py`)
- **Pattern Detection**: Structuring, layering, smurfing, round-tripping, high frequency, unusual timing
- **Risk Assessment**: Low, medium, high, critical risk levels with configurable thresholds
- **Compliance Features**: Regulatory pattern detection and flagging
- **Real-time Analysis**: Transaction-by-transaction AML scoring
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Adjustable sensitivity for different compliance requirements

### 2. **Credit Scoring Service** (`src/services/credit_scoring.py`)
- **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Payment history (35%), credit utilization (30%), credit length (15%), credit mix (10%), new credit (10%)
- **Risk Levels**: Excellent, good, fair, poor, very poor with 300-850 score range
- **Credit Decisions**: Approve, approve with conditions, manual review, decline
- **Pre-approval**: Quick creditworthiness estimates without full applications
- **Confidence Scoring**: Data completeness and reliability assessment

### 3. **AML API Routes** (`src/routes/aml.py`)
- **POST /v1/aml/analyze** - Single transaction AML analysis
- **POST /v1/aml/analyze/batch** - Batch transaction analysis
- **GET /v1/aml/patterns** - Available AML pattern types
- **GET /v1/aml/statistics** - AML service performance metrics
- **POST /v1/aml/thresholds/update** - Adjustable detection thresholds
- **GET /v1/aml/health** - AML service health monitoring

### 4. **Credit Scoring API Routes** (`src/routes/credit.py`)

### 5. **Enhanced Fraud Detection Integration** (`src/services/fraud_detection.py`)
- **Four-Model Ensemble**: Tabular (40%) + Anomaly (15%) + Graph (25%) + AML (20%)
- **Comprehensive Explanations**: Feature importance + graph evidence + AML patterns
- **Real-time AML Integration**: Every transaction analyzed for AML patterns
- **Enhanced Decision Making**: Multi-dimensional risk assessment
