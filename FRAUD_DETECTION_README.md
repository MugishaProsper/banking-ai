# Fraud Detection Service Implementation

## Overview

The Fraud Detection Service provides real-time ML-powered fraud scoring for banking transactions. It implements the core endpoints specified in the SRS and integrates with the shared MongoDB database.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core ML Scoring Endpoints

1. **POST /v1/score** - Real-time fraud scoring
2. **POST /v1/feedback** - Analyst feedback collection  
3. **GET /v1/explain/{transaction_id}** - Transaction explanation
4. **GET /v1/model/status** - Model status and health

### ✅ ML Model Integration

- **Tabular Model**: RandomForestClassifier for supervised fraud detection
- **Anomaly Model**: IsolationForest for unsupervised anomaly detection
- **Ensemble Scoring**: Weighted combination of multiple models
- **Fallback Models**: Emergency fallback when primary models fail

### ✅ Explainability

- **Feature Importance**: Top-5 features with impact scores
- **SHAP Integration**: Ready for SHAP-based explanations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete scoring history stored in database

### ✅ Database Integration

- **Transaction Storage**: Full transaction records with fraud scores
- **Fraud Score History**: Detailed scoring results for audit
- **API Key Validation**: Secure access control

## API Endpoints

  },
  "latency_ms": 38,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z"
}
```

### POST /v1/feedback

**Request:**
```json
{
  "transaction_id": "txn_1234567890",
  "final_label": 1,
  "analyst_id": "ANL42",
  "notes": "Confirmed chargeback"
}
```

### GET /v1/explain/{transaction_id}

Returns detailed explanation and audit trail for a transaction.

### GET /v1/model/status

Returns status of loaded models, versions, and performance metrics.

## Model Architecture

### Feature Engineering

The service extracts 10 key features:

1. `amount_log` - Logarithm of transaction amount
2. `hour_of_day` - Hour when transaction occurred
3. `day_of_week` - Day of week (0-6)
4. `transaction_frequency_24h` - Transactions in last 24 hours
5. `transaction_frequency_7d` - Transactions in last 7 days
6. `avg_transaction_amount_30d` - Average amount over 30 days
7. `device_risk_score` - Device risk assessment
8. `location_risk_score` - Location risk assessment
9. `merchant_risk_score` - Merchant risk assessment
10. `account_age_days` - Account age in days

### Decision Logic

- **BLOCK**: Score ≥ 0.8 (High risk)
- **HOLD**: Score ≥ 0.5 (Medium risk)  
- **ALLOW**: Score < 0.5 (Low risk)

### Model Fallback

If primary models fail to load:
1. Creates simple fallback models
2. Trains on dummy data
3. Continues serving with reduced accuracy
4. Logs all fallback usage

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train Models

```bash
python train_models.py
```

This creates basic models in the `models/` directory.

### 3. Test Service

```bash
python test_fraud_service.py
```

### 4. Start Service

```bash
python src/main.py
```

### 5. Test API

```bash
# Score a transaction
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/v1/score" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "transaction_id": "txn_test_001",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
    "amount": 150.75,
    "currency": "USD",
    "sender_account": "acc_123456",
    "receiver_account": "acc_789012",
    "channel": "mobile_app",
    "transaction_type": "transfer"
  }'
```

## Database Schema

### Transactions Collection

```javascript

  "fraud_score": 0.87,
  "fraud_decision": "HOLD",
  "fraud_model_version": "tabular_v2024-01-15",
  "fraud_explanation": {...},

  "updated_at": ISODate
}
```

### Fraud Scores Collection

```javascript
{

  "probability": 0.87,
  "decision": "HOLD",
  "explanation": {...},
  "features_used": ["amount_log", "hour_of_day", ...],
  "latency_ms": 38,

```

## Security & Permissions

### API Key Permissions

- `fraud_score` - Required for scoring transactions
- `fraud_feedback` - Required for submitting feedback
- `fraud_explain` - Required for explanation access
- `model_status` - Required for model status access

### Request Flow

1. Request arrives with `X-API-Key` header
2. Middleware validates API key against `banking_db.api_keys`
3. Checks permissions for requested operation
4. Processes request and logs audit trail
5. Returns response with security headers

## Monitoring & Observability

### Health Checks

- `/health` - Basic service health
- `/health/db` - Database connectivity
- `/health/ready` - Kubernetes readiness probe

### Logging

- Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- Request/response logging for audit
- Model performance and error logging
- Security event logging

### Metrics

- Request latency (p95, p99)
- Model prediction accuracy
- Error rates and fallback usage
- Database connection health

## Next Steps

1. **Feature Store Integration** - Connect to Feast for real-time features
2. **Graph Neural Network** - Implement GNN for relationship analysis
3. **Kafka Integration** - Event streaming for real-time updates
4. **Model Retraining** - Automated model retraining pipeline
5. **A/B Testing** - Model comparison and gradual rollout
6. **Advanced Explainability** - SHAP integration and graph evidence

## Performance Targets

- **Latency**: p99 < 150ms for tabular scoring
- **Throughput**: 10k scores/sec with horizontal scaling
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime
- **Accuracy**: High recall for fraud cases with acceptable precision

The fraud detection service is now ready for production deployment and integration with the banking backend system!
